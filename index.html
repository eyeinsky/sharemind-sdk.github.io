  <h1>Sharemind SDK 2016.12 Beta</h1>
  <h2>Introducing the Sharemind Software Development Kit</h2>
  <p><b>What is Sharemind?</b> Sharemind is a novel database and
  application server</a> that collects data in an encrypted form and uses techniques like homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation and hardware isolation to process it <i>without leaking the private inputs even to the machine memory</i>, providing <i>end-to-end encrypted data processing</i>.</p>
  <p><b>How to use Sharemind?</b> The <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/">Sharemind Application Server</a> is a commercial offering</a> from <a href="http://www.cyber.ee/">Cybernetica</a> that offers consulting, licensing and engineering services for secure computing applications. Find contacts on the <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/">Sharemind web page</a>.</p>
  </p>
  <p><b>Can I try Sharemind?</b> The Sharemind Software Development Kit (SDK) contains the SecreC 2 programming language that separates public data and secrets on a type system level and an emulator that you can use to estimate the running time of your application in a fully encrypted environment.</p>
  <p><b>How can I deploy later?</b> Your SecreC programs will be fully compatible with the
  Sharemind Application Server, that runs the code using full cryptographic
  protection and provides support for enterprise applications.</p>

  <h2>Download SDK version 2016.12</h2>
  <p>There are two ways for getting the SDK.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download a preinstalled virtual machine image from the
    <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/sdk.html">SDK download page</a>.
    The image can be used with virtualization products like
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> or
    <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>.</li>
    <li>Build the tools from the source code found on
      <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk">Github</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>The following assumes that you have installed the virtual machine image
  into a tool like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Run the Qt Creator tool from the desktop.</li>
    <li>Open an example program from <i>/home/sharemind/demos</i> with
    <i>Ctrl+O</i> (or select <i>File->Open File or Project...</i> from the
    menu).</li>
    <li>Compile the program with <i>Ctrl+F1</i> (or select
    <i>Tools->External->Sharemind SDK->Compile SecreC</i> from the menu).</li>
    <li>Run the program in the emulator with <i>Ctrl+F2</i> (or select
    <i>Tools->External->Sharemind SDK->Run SecreC</i> from the menu).</li>
    <li>Read the printed output and the estimated running time from the console window.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>The following developer resources are currently available:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="stdlib/reference/index.html">SecreC 2 language and standard
        library reference</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Support and feedback</h2>
  <p>We are very interested in your feedback. Please report technical issues on
  <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues">the SDK Github
  issues page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>We would also like to know, what features to focus on next. What did you
  try to do with the SDK? What new features would you like? Please let us know
  at <a href="mailto:sharemind@cyber.ee">sharemind@cyber.ee</a>.</p>

  <h2>Changelog</h2>
  <b>2015.12</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a new execution profile visualizer tool (available under the SDK tools in QtCreator). This tool helps you visualize performance bottlenecks.</li>
    <li>Added new SecreC code examples (e.g. how to use the database).</li>
    <li>Replaced emulator performance models with more precise ones.  Currently, models exist for unsigned integer types, though - we are at work to improve this.</li>
    <li>Added two new modules emulating the ABY and Fresco secure computation systems from TU Darmstadt and Alexandra Institute.</li>
    <li>Added a table based database module with an HDF5 backend.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>2015.01</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial release.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>The SDK is limited to developing and profiling single secure programs. To
  license the full Sharemind system,
  <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/sdk.html">please contact Cybernetica</a>.
  </p>

  <p>These issues affect version 2015.12:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The performance models currently represent a deployment with direct 1
    Gbit network connections between the servers. Future versions will be more
    configurable.</li>
    <li>Not all private operations have performance models. Currently, only
    unsigned integer operations have models.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please report other issues
  <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues">the SDK Github
    issues page</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Performance</h2>
  <p>Secure computing has its distinct overhead. Also, optimizing algorithms for
  secure computing is a complex task. E.g., parallel operations are much more
  efficient than sequential operations (try multiplying two integers vs
  multiplying two 100 000-element vectors). For further information see
  <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/research.html">our research page</a>.</p>
