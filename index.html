  <h1>Sharemind SDK Beta</h1>
  <h2>Introducing the Sharemind Software Development Kit</h2>
  <p>Sharemind is a <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/">novel database and
  application server</a> that can process encrypted data without decrypting it.
  Its is based on secure multi-party computation and has been used to protect
  privacy and business secrets in various applications.</p>
  <p>The experimental Sharemind SDK contains the SecreC 2 programming language
  that separates public data and secrets on a type system level and an emulator
  that you can use to estimate the running time of your application in a fully
  encrypted environment. Your SecreC programs will be fully compatible with the
  Sharemind Application Server, that runs the code using full cryptographic
  protection and provides support for enterprise applications.</p>

  <h2>Download version 2015.01</h2>
  <p>There are two ways for getting the SDK.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Download a preinstalled virtual machine image from
    <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/sdk.html">http://sharemind.cyber.ee/sdk.html</a>.
    This can be used with a tool like
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
    <li>Build the tools from source code at
    <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk">https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>The following assumes that you have installed the virtual machine image
  into a tool like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Run the Qt Creator tool from the desktop.</li>
    <li>Open an example program from <i>/home/sharemind/demos</i> with
    <i>Ctrl+O</i> (or select <i>File->Open File or Project...</i> from the
    menu).</li>
    <li>Compile the program with <i>Ctrl+F1</i> (or select
    <i>Tools->External->Sharemind SDK->Compile SecreC</i> from the menu).</li>
    <li>Run the program in the emulator with <i>Ctrl+F2</i> (or select
    <i>Tools->External->Sharemind SDK->Run SecreC</i> from the menu).</li>
    <li>Read the printed output and the estimated running time from the console window.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>
  <p>The following developer resources are currently available:</p>
  <ul>
    </li><a href="stdlib/reference/index.html">http://sharemind-sdk.github.io/stdlib/reference/</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Support and feedback</h2>
  <p>We are very interested in your feedback. Please report technical issues at
  <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues">https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues</a>.
  </p>
  <p>We would also like to know, what features to focus on next. What did you
  try to do with the SDK? What new features would you like? Please let us know
  at <a href="mailto:sharemind@cyber.ee">sharemind@cyber.ee</a></p>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>
  <p>The SDK is limited to developing and profiling single secure programs. To
  license the full Sharemind system,
  <a href="http://sharemind.cyber.ee/sdk.html">please contact Cybernetica</a>.
  </p>

  <p>These issues affect version 2015.01:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This version does not yet have any database support.</li>
    <li>The performance models currently represent a deployment with direct 1
    Gbit network connections between the servers. Future versions will be more
    configurable.</li>
    <li>Not all private operations have performance models. However, most of the
    arithmetic is modelled well.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Please report other issues at
  <a href="https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues">https://github.com/sharemind-sdk/build-sdk/issues</a>.

  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p>The SecreC 2 language and virtual machine were developed with support from
  the United States DARPA
  <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/I2O/Programs/PROgramming_Computation_on_EncryptEd_Data_(PROCEED).aspx">PROCEED</a>
  programme.</p>
  <p>The SecreC statistics library has been developed within the FP 7
  <a href="http://www.usable-security.eu/">UaESMC</a> project.</p>
  <p>The emulator has been built with support from European Union Framework
  Programme 7 project <a href="http://practice-project.eu/">PRACTICE</a>.</p>
